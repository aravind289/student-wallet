# Student Wallet
A small SPA using React with Firebase as the backend and Bulma for styling developed in a span of 4 days.

### Goal
As a student it's easy to lose track of money. Students prefer to track money mentally instead of using a wallet app as most of them are complex. Keeping this in mind, this wallet app is built with simplicity in mind giving students a simple, intuitive wallet app.

### Worked on
- Firebase's Realtime database. Which paired with React state updates gives superfast data changes.
- Using Firebase for authenticating users.
- Creating Bulma Components.
- Hosting using Firebase.

### Can add features
- Better categories
- React countdown for the app money
- Display more details
