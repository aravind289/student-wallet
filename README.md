# Student Wallet
A small SPA using React with Firebase as the backend and Bulma for styling.
Here's the [website](https://student-wallet-react.firebaseapp.com/). You can take a look.
### Goal
Keep track of a student's expenditures in real life.

### Warning
This isn't a complete app. 
This app has:
- bad coding styles
- no animations
- easy shortcuts
- no form validation
- logic and view in the same react component
as it was developed on a relatively short timespan.

### What I learnt?
- Firebase is amazing for real time data. Updates faster than I can switch tabs.
- Firebase is amazing for authentication. Using Firebase Phone authentication here.
- Firebase is amazing for hosting. Easy init'ing and hosting.
- Creating Bulma components (esp. form) is very helpful.

### Can add features
- Better categories
- React countdown for the app money
- Display more details
